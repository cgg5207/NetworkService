OK, I'll share this with you, but I am in no way responsible for what will happen if you actually use this, USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.  There are more security vulnerabilities here than (some catchy analogy).  It would be trivial to access sensitive files with this server.  No filters, NONE.

Alright, where was I.  Oh yeah, this is a little webbie server I wrote to solidify my knowledge of gzipping your data to a web browser.  No standards are really followed, just hacked it up to play with gzipping data.  cool stuff.

Oh yeah, USE AT YOUR OWN RISK......
